# Change Log
All notable changes to the project will be documented in this file.

## [ 14 - 1.13.1.0 ] - 2024-05-07
Try with wildest matching.
### Important
You can have just one wildest in a row.
The first one will get as mush as possible as it matches in a hungry mode.
Cases like {!key1}{!key2} will leave null for key2.
Also be careful key2 will be null and still "pass" as a match.
So use with care.
